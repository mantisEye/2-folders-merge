This program will read all files in the source1 folder, move all files to a new folder(merged). It will rename all files upon transfer. It will then do the same with source2. At the end, source1 & source2 will be merged into 1 folder. The program will also produce a .txt file listing all the name changes. 


New change to implement: it no longer overwrite files name upon a transfer, instead it adds a 's1-3' before the original name. s1 or s2 is which source folder, followed by a number counter. 
No need for the txt file. 
Also, we can make it multiple source files.
